# AdventOfCodeWhippet-Public

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fantastic annual programming challenge created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/). I was vaguely aware of it from ~2018-ish, but I'd never given it a proper go until a good friend of mine started participating in 2022 and asked if I was joining in. 2022 was the first year I tried the challenge and I was hooked.

Since that first year I've used the challenges as a playground to try out new languages, new features in old languages, different styles and generally just to enjoy messing around in code without the constraints of making something actually shippable.

After finishing AoC 2024 I decided to set myself a challenge to put together a full 500 star repo. All puzzles in the same Visual Studio solution, all puzzle solutions running from start to finish in the same executable. This is that repo.

## How I Play

I don't compete for the leaderboards and I don't aim for the fastest/smallest solutions. I generally just go for solutions that I think are 'neat' and/or scratch whatever programming itch I happen to want to scratch that day.

The one rule I impose on myself is that I won't look at anyone else's solution until I've got a solution myself. On one or two occasions I've gone back and tweaked my solution after looking at other solutions [that people have posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), either because my runtime ended up truly abysmal or because someone else's approach looked like fun, but almost all of the solutions in the repo are (for better or worse) my own.

There's only [one puzzle](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1iwf5tk/2018_day_13_part_2_preconceptions_tripped_me_up/) where I've had to look at someone else's solution to find out which part of the puzzle spec I was reading incorrectly.

Since starting to put this repo together I've also started trying to make sure my solutions would work with any inputs: no hard-coding puzzle-specific constants.

## Completion Order

Over the last couple of years I've been steadily expanding and refining the utility library that I use, but because I've not completed the years in chronological order, it's a bit of a mixed bag of styles and features used if you try to follow through from one year to the next. If you're wondering why the code from one year isn't using a helpful feature used in a previous year, it's probably this.

* **2022 - [C#] Completed "real-time"**
* 2021 - [C++]
* 2020 - [C++]
* *2019 - [Python] Incomplete attempt. [Intcode](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) was a bad year to try to learn Python.*
* **2023 - [C++] Completed "real-time"**
* **2024 - [C++] Completed "real-time"**
* 2015 - [C++]
* 2016 - [C++]
* 2017 - [C++]
* 2018 - [C++]
* 2019 - [C++] Ported my terrible Python code and finally finished off the year
* 2022 - [C++] Ported my original C# solutions over to C++
