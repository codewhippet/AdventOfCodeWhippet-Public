# AdventOfCodeWhippet-Public

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fantastic annual programming challenge created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/). I was vaguely aware of it some years ago, but I'd never given it a proper go until a good friend of mine started participating in 2022 and asked if I was joining in. 2022 was the first year I tried the challenge and I was hooked.

Since that first year I've used the challenges as a playground to try out new languages, try new features in old languages, try different styles and generally just to enjoy messing around in code without the constraints of making something actually shippable.

After finishing AoC 2024 I decided to set myself a challenge to put together a full 500 star repo. All puzzles in the same Visual Studio solution, all puzzle solutions running from start to finish in the same executable. This is that repo.

## How I Play

I don't compete for the leaderboards and I don't aim for the fastest/smallest solutions. I generally just go for solutions that I think are 'neat' and/or scratch whatever programming itch I happen to want to scratch that day.

The one rule I impose on myself is that I won't look at anyone else's solution until I've got a solution myself. On one or two occasions I've gone back and tweaked my solution after looking at other solutions [that people have posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), either because my runtime ended up truly abysmal or because someone else's approach looked like fun, but almost all of the solutions in the repo are (for better or worse) my own.

There's only [one puzzle](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1iwf5tk/2018_day_13_part_2_preconceptions_tripped_me_up/) where I've had to look at someone else's solution to find out which part of the puzzle spec I was reading incorrectly before I had my own solution.

Since starting to put this repo together I've also tried to make sure my solutions would work with any inputs: no hard-coding puzzle-specific constants.

## Completion Order

Over the last couple of years I've been steadily expanding and refining the utility library that I use. Because I've not completed the years in chronological order, it's a bit of a mixed bag of styles and features if you try to follow through from one year to the next. If you're wondering why the code from one year isn't using a helpful feature used in a previous year, it's probably because of this!

* **2022 - [C#] Completed "real-time"**
* 2021 - [C++]
* 2020 - [C++]
* *2019 - [Python] Incomplete attempt. The year of [Intcode](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) was a bad year to try to learn Python.*
* **2023 - [C++] Completed "real-time"**
* **2024 - [C++] Completed "real-time"**
* 2015 - [C++]
* 2016 - [C++]
* 2017 - [C++]
* 2018 - [C++]
* 2019 - [C++] Ported my terrible Python code and finally finished off the year
* 2022 - [C++] Ported my original C# solutions over to C++

## Wall of Nemeses

In most years there seems to be at least one puzzle that stumps me for a day or two (or three). There are often two or three puzzles which are finicky and require hours of careful debugging and re-reading the specs, but the days that make my nemesis wall are the ones where I either didn't even have a clue what a (reasonable runtime) solution would look like at first, or the ones that took an unreasonably large amount of faffing for me to get right.

## Wall Of Shame

The total runtime on my laptop for all puzzles across all years is ~9 minutes 20 seconds; at less than a minute per year on average I'm not totally unhappy with the runtimes of my solutions. These are the days which aren't all that fast (and might get revisited at some point):

* [2016 Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/11)
* [2016 Day 14: One-Time Pad](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/14)

* [2024 Day 24: Crossed Wires](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24)

## No Littering

The whole point of Advent of Code is for YOU to have fun challenging yourself and maybe learning something new. Please don't download this code if your only intention is to run it just for the sake of getting stars. Not only does this pollute the stats for everyone else, you're also depriving *yourself* of the satisfaction of either solving or implementing a solution to a puzzle.

Good luck and have fun!
